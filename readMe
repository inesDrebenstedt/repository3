This is a text adventure with scene pics based on the movie Pet Sematary (1989).
I am still in the process of asking Paramount Pictures for permission to use screenshots 
of their movie.
Thus, the resources (scene pictures + sound files) are not available yet.
This work was part of an exam for my Java development class at alfatraining GmbH.
